                <p>Humanoid Robots are complex anthropomorphic artificial machines. The growing interest in humanoclass robots accompanied by the latest and ever-increasing technological advancements in the field of robotics, locomotion, and AI, achieved by engineers, has speeded up their development over the past decade. Moreover, because of their human-like shape, these robots can use the same equipment and environment as humans, hence, making them more compatible to be used as a building platform for the physical implementation of the Digital Twin.</p>

Humanoclass robotics is not an attempt to recreate humans. The goal is not, nor should it ever be, to make machines that can be mistaken for or used interchangeably with real human beings. Rather, the goal is to create a new kind of tool, fundamentally different from any we have yet seen because it is designed to work with humans as well as for them. Humanoclasss will interact socially with people in typical, everyday environments. We already have robots to do tedious, repetitive labor for specialized environments and tasks. Instead, humanoclasss will be designed to act safely alongsclasse humans, extending our capabilities in a wclasse variety of tasks and environments.</p>
