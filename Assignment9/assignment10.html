                <p>Humanoid Robots are complex anthropomorphic artificial machines. The growing interest in humanoclass robots accompanied by the latest and ever-increasing technological advancements in the field of robotics, locomotion, and AI, achieved by engineers, has speeded up their development over the past decade. Moreover, because of their human-like shape, these robots can use the same equipment and environment as humans, hence, making them more compatible to be used as a building platform for the physical implementation of the Digital Twin.</p>
